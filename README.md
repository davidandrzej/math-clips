# Math clips

Some instructional math animations created using the
[manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) "community edition",
library, which is itself a fork of
[3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) created by Grant Sanderson
of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) fame.


## Content subject matter 

These clips are mostly inspired by topics encountered while working
through [_Quantum Computation and Quantum Information_ by Michael
A. Nielsen and Isaac
L. Chuang](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6AEFFEA52D53BE9AE#overview),
supplemented by:

* [_Abstract Algebra_ by I. N. Herstein](https://www.amazon.com/Abstract-Algebra-I-N-Herstein/dp/0471368792)
* [_Linear Algebra Done Right_ by Sheldon Axler](https://linear.axler.net/)

TODO: some brief blurb here about what each clip is illustrating

## How to run 

_Assuming the environment is all set up nicely_ (!!!), movies can be generated like:

```
manim -p cosets.py CosetsAndWaveInZ12
```
